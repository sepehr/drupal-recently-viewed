Description
===========
The module tracks recently viewed nodes for both anonymous and authenticated users.
Module provides an API function for other modules to get a list of recently views items. This by itself defines 
a "recently viewed items block" but you might want to enable the recently_viewed_views.module which provides a 
customised default View, so you can benefit the endless flexibility.


Recommended Modules 
===================
Here is a list of recommended modules to be used with recently_viewed_views.module:

  - Views Argument Sort (http://drupal.org/project/views_argsort)

  - Views Slideshow (http://drupal.org/project/views_slideshow)
  Using this you can show the recently viewed items in a slideshow format.
