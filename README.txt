Description
===========
The module tracks recently viewed nodes for both anonymous and authenticated users.
Module provides an API function for other modules to get a list of recently views items. This by itself defines 
a "recently viewed items block" but you might want to enable the recently_viewed_views.module which provides a 
customised default View, so you can benefit the endless flexibility.

Submodule Dependencies
======================
